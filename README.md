# Idea Repository
This is a repository containing ideas

## Why
People might ask "why? Why would anybody put up their good ideas for
everybody to use?"

The answer is simply, that some people have too many ideas. Often ideas take
offset in a piece of software that somebody wants, but they don't actually
have the time to implement it. This is the chance to let everybody with
enough time create fantastic applications.

Furthermore some people have troubles administering their time. This is
an opportunity to get some of their future ideas

## Principles
The repositories hosted under this team should follow some design principles.

* __Micro Commitments:__ Ideas are something volatile, where we also need to
  capture small details. Therefore all ideas should be formed in a way allowing
  for quickly capturing the idea and easily adding perspectives.

## The Idea
An idea repository contains

* A __README.md__ file containing the pitch and the list of contributors.
* A __demo__ folder which shows demonstrations of different parts of the idea.
  These demonstrations can be as undone as possible, down to just showcasing
  a simple feature or part idea.
* The files __business.md__, __implementation.md__, and __marketing.md__
  contains reflections on these respective areas.
