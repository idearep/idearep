    <h1>Repositories with ideas!</h1>
    <p>OK, so this is an unreasonable ugly website, but this is not the point
    (and hey! it is responsive!).
    The point is that this is a bunch of repositories containing ideas which are
    released under the Creative Commons license. This means that everybody are
    free to use them, but that previous collaborators needs to be credited.</p>
    
    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>People might ask "why? Why would anybody put up their good ideas for
    everybody to use?"</p>
    
    <p>The answer is simply, that some people have too many ideas. Often ideas take
    offset in a piece of software that somebody wants, but they don't actually
    have the time to implement it. This is the chance to let everybody with
    enough time create fantastic applications.</p>
    
    <p>Furthermore some people have troubles administering their time. This is
    an opportunity to get some of their future ideas
    
    <h1>The Idea</h1>
    <p>The minimum requirements for an idea to be here is that there is
    reflected on the following parts:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Business Prospects / Social Prospects: The idea needs to help in some
      way.</li>
    </ul>
    
    There is a template for a readme file. it is called idea-README.md.
    
    <h1>The list</h1>
    <p>Is empty so far!</p>
